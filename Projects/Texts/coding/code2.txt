<h1 class="highlighted-points">The Website</h1>
This website is powered by extensive JavaScript, ensuring smooth button functionality and interactions. JavaScript was a new language for me, but having learned Python, I found it easier to grasp. Furthermore, I was able to explore my ability to create an effective and stylistic UI, to complement my previous back-end skills.

<h1 class="highlighted-points">Learning</h1>
Learning JavaScript opened up a new coding avenue, especially given its prevalence in web development. 


I integrated HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create user-friendly, functional apps.

This website required:

- Advanced functions
- Local storage
- Dynamic HTML manipulation
- Element addition and removal
- CSS manipulation within JavaScript
- Transitions and transformations
